# Zdalniacy

A prototype of a web application with job offers for people with motor disabilities - a project realized for master's thesis. Realized with the cooperation of Leże i Pracuję (Work from Bed - https://lezeipracuje.pl/). The goal was to motivate the disabled to self-develop and find more abitious jobs specially dedicated for well educated people with disabilities such as programmer, designer, copyrighter etc. The interesting part was to not allow anyone apply for any given job. In order to apply, the user has to first accomplish a given set of required lessons that will prove his level of competence which, on one hand, limits the number of unqualified applications and, on the other, motivates the disabled to learn new skills. 

&#x1F53A; **Only in Polish!**
&#x1F53A; **Only for desktop (not responsive)!** Because this project was targeted to people with mobility issues, the studies have shown that everyone prefers to use a full sized computer or laptop and not a mobile device. &#x1F53A;
